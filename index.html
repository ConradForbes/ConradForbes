                        <h2>About me</h1>
                            <p>
                                I am a self-taught front-end software developer from Aberdeen, Scotland. I come from an engineering background 
                                having studied Biomedical Engineering (BEng Hons) at the University of Surrey and Biomaterials & Tissue Engineering
                                (MSc) at Univeristy College London. I have software, engineering, and finance experience.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Throughout both of my degrees, I was drawn to areas that used specialised software, and had an affinity towards projects based
                                on the develoment or implementation of software. This sparked my interest in learning how softwares were developed and deployed.
                                I have a keen interest in furthering my skillset and knowlegde into back-end software development, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I am proficient in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I can also use Python and am comfortable with SQL. I am skilled in a variety of software, 
                                including computer-aided design (CAD), finite element analysis (FEA), and computational fluid dynamics (CFD).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I am determined, focused, hardworking, and team-oriented, with a strong work ethic. Away from the computer I enjoy exercise and travelling, I 
                                am an accomplished rower who has represented Team GB, Scotland, and my university.

                                    <p>Since self-teaching myself front-end software development skills like HTML, CSS, and 
                                        JavaScript, I've built several websites for personal development and small businesses. 
                                        My goal is to create visually appealing and responsive websites that showcase my 
                                        innovative and creative side.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I applied my knowledge to create a website for a budding sports and exercise 
                                        nutritionist in London (<a href="https://jwsportsnutritionlondon.com/" target="_blank">click here</a> 
                                        to see her site). The website provides information about the nutritionist and her business, 
                                        including the services she offers and a link to a client portal. She provided me with details 
                                        such as colour schemes and information to include on the site; otherwise, I was free to design 
                                        the site as I saw fit. She was thrilled with the results.

                                    <p>
                                        During my master's degree, I lead a project that developed computational models 
                                        to compare the brain tissue interactions of a healthy person to a person who has 
                                        suffered a traumatic brain injury.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        A model of key areas of the brain vasculature was created using CAD software. 
                                        The model was based on the posterior Circle of Willis and included the blood 
                                        vessel wall and 2mm of surrounding tissue. The surrounding tissue was incorporated 
                                        to gain a better understanding of how the brain tissue reacted in different conditions.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Preliminary simulations were computed using CFD software to determine the blood flow 
                                        rate and pressure throughout the model; the data obtained here was used to build thorough 
                                        computational models of smaller model sections where FEA software and CFD software were
                                         used simultaneously to determine the blood flow characteristics and resulting vasculature 
                                         deformation in both subjects.
                                    </p>

                                        During the final year of my undergraduate degree, I 
                                        worked on a project to design an exoskeleton for a patient
                                         with lower-limb paralysis.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Before the project's design stage could begin, research on 
                                        previously designed exoskeletons was conducted to determine 
                                        the appropriate features that would be required on the exoskeleton
                                         to ensure that it was functional for its purpose.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        CAD software was used to create the exoskeleton model, while FEA 
                                        software was used to analyse the properties of the model. The waist 
                                        segment of the model was made up of a rounded bar that wrapped around 
                                        the back of the patient and housed the model's battery. The hip joints 
                                        had two degrees of freedom, while the knee and ankle joints only had one. 
                                        The foot was designed to be large enough to accommodate an average shoe,
                                         and it also had sensors to detect obstacles in front of the model.

                                    <p id="subtitle">Investigating OpenSim as a Gait Analysis Software</p>
                                    <p>
                                        During my bachelor's degree dissertation project, I investigated whether 
                                        a new software called OpenSim was suitable for gait analysis. OpenSim 
                                        was a novel open-source software that claimed to be capable of calculating 
                                        individual muscle forces in the human body during gait, a feat that no other 
                                        all-in-one gait analysis software on the market had accomplished.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        There was very little information available online about the OpenSim software, 
                                        so extensive research was required to develop an understanding of the software 
                                        before any conclusions could be drawn. The software received positional data 
                                        as an input and projected it onto one of the software's models. The models 
                                        were made up of the entire human skeleton as well as several muscles.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        To convert the input data into the correct format for OpenSim, MATLAB was used. 
                                        Once I had the OpenSim software working with my input data, I compared the 
                                        resulting muscle force graphs to those found in the literature to determine the 
                                        software's accuracy and precision. The data was very similar, so it was determined 
                                        that the OpenSim software could be used as a gait analysis tool that also measures 
                                        individual muscle forces. This would reduce the cost required to conduct high-quality 
                                        gait analysis because you would no longer need to purchase additional equipment to 
                                        measure muscle forces.

                                        During my bachelor's degree final year, I worked on a project in which I used 
                                        biomedical signal processing to determine the characteristics of several disorders.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        MATLAB was used for the majority of the analysis for this project. To process data 
                                        from various sources, several different signal processing methods and techniques were 
                                        used. Patients with Alzheimer's disease and epilepsy were studied using electroencephalogram 
                                        (EEG) signals. Patients with cardiac Autonomic Neuropathy were studied using 
                                        electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. Hydrocephalus patients were studied using intracranial
                                         pressure (ICP) signals.

                                        This project's aim was to develop high-quality analyses of biomedical signals in order 
                                        to draw accurate conclusions about the characteristics of each disorder. The signals of 
                                        the disordered subjects were compared to the signals of a healthy subject in all cases. 
                                        Filtering, classical and modern spectral analysis, time-frequency analysis, discrete wavelet 
                                        analysis, signal power spectrum estimation, and non-linear techniques were among the signal
                                         processing techniques employed.

                                    <p id="subtitle">Prosthetic Hand Design Project</p>
                                    <p>During the second year of my undergraduate studies, 
                                        I worked on a project in which I designed and manufactured 
                                        a prosthetic hand for a young female amputee.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Significant research was required to ensure that the model was
                                         functional, made of suitable materials, and had the desired 
                                         dimensions. Two small servo motors located within the palm would
                                          power the hand, and pressure sensors would be placed on the tips 
                                         of the fingers.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The prosthetic model was designed and developed using CAD software,
                                         and its mechanical properties were determined using FEA analysis 
                                         software. The finished model was a hand with five string-actuated 
                                         fingers. The thumb and index finger were controlled by one servo 
                                         motor, while the remaining three fingers were controlled by the other. 
                                         The design included pressure sensors and a temperature sensor to ensure 
                                         that the prosthetic 'shut-off' if the model was subjected to excessive 
                                         temperatures or force.
